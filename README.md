is the part of computer science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements, design, implimentation, testing, development and maintenance
planning -The initial stage of software development, Planning, involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route. We uncover the tasks at hand during this phase and strategize for efficient execution
Requirement -Phase 2 of the SDLC, Requirements Analysis, seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. In this phase, the team is looking to answer, “What are the expectations of our users from our software?” This is called requirements gathering
Design - he Design phase is all about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software’s functionality and aesthetic. This ultimately results in the software product. The emphasis lies on outlining the software’s structure, navigation, user interfaces, and database design. This phase ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs its tasks efficiently
Coding - The Coding phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.
Testing - Consider the Testing phase of the SDLC as a stringent quality inspection on a production line. It is when vulnerabilities are uncovered. Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding. The aim is to ensure flawless software operation before it reaches the end-users. And even identify opportunities for enhancement.
Development - After crafting a product with precision, it’s time to present it to the users by pushing to the production environment. The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.
Maintenance - In the Software Development Life Cycle, the maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages examples Tech startup developing a mobile app	(Agile), Government software for public records	(Waterfall)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer designs and builds computer programs that power mobile devices, desktop computers, and even cars. They not only identify user needs but also create new applications for any given market while making improvements based on feedback from users. Reviewing quality specifications and technical design documents to provide timely and meaningful feedback. Creating detailed, comprehensive and well-structured test plans and test cases. Estimating, prioritizing, planning and coordinating quality testing activities. A Project Manager in Software Development is a crucial role responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. They align project objectives with business goals, manage resources and mitigate risks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a powerful software application that brings together essential tools for software development within a single graphical user interface (GUI). An IDE combines commonly used developer tools, such as a code editor, compiler, and debugger, into a unified GUI application with an integrated terminal.The Importance of IDEs
While coding or developing applications without an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is possible—such as by using a basic text editor like Notepad—IDEs offer several advantages that greatly improve the development experience. Version Control Integration
Version control systems (VCS) are crucial for managing changes to source code over time, and many IDEs integrate with popular version control systems like Git to provide a seamless experience for developers:

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Lack of work flow visibility, Broken SDLC Processes, Lack of Predictability In Software Delivery, The Problems With Development Velocity, Scalability, Security, and Performance Challenges
Scalability, Security, and Performance Challenges Invest in tools that empower your teams to make data-driven decisions: 

Project management tools
Engineering analytics tools
Observability & monitoring tools

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

The most common types of testing levels include – unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit tests focus on individual components, such as methods and functions, while integration tests check if these components work together properly.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data. Further, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
